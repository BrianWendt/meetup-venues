This plugin allows you to list Meetup.com events associated to a venue.

== Description ==

Meetup Venues allows you to list Meetup.com events associated to a venue. This plugin is useful for the venue's
website to display what is going on at their venue.

A caveat to this plugin; when groups/users post events they do not always use the existing venue. This results in there
being more than one venue listed per real physical location.
