This plugin allows you to list Meetup.com events associated to a venue.

== Description ==

Meetup Venues allows you to list Meetup.com events associated to a venue. This plugin is useful for the venue's
website to display what is going on at their venue.

A caveat to this plugin; when groups/users post events they do not always use the existing venue. This results in there
being more than one venue listed per real physical location.

== Installation ==

After installing and activating this plugin, you will need to provide your Meetup.com API key.

Your key can be acquired here: https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to be a member of Meetup.com? =

Yes, in order to get an API key you will need to be a member. However this plugin uses nothing else from your account.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
